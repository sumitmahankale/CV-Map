## System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **WhatsApp Simulator** (`whatsapp_simulator.py`)
   - Simulates receiving resume messages from WhatsApp
   - Queue-based message handling
   - Can handle text resumes or file attachments
   - In production: Integrates with WhatsApp Business API or Twilio

2. **File Processor** (`file_processor.py`)
   - Supports PDF, DOCX, and TXT file formats
   - Extracts raw text from documents
   - Uses PyPDF2 for PDF parsing and python-docx for Word documents

3. **Data Extractor** (`data_extractor.py`)
   - **Core NLP Engine**: Extracts key information from resume text
   - Uses regex patterns for structured data:
     - Email addresses (validated format)
     - Phone numbers (India/US formats)
     - Names (capitalized patterns)
   - Keyword-based extraction for:
     - Education (B.Tech, MBA, Bachelor, Master, etc.)
     - Skills (Python, Java, React, AWS, etc.)
     - Experience (job titles, durations, achievements)

4. **Google Sheets Handler** (`google_sheets_handler.py`)
   - Integrates with Google Sheets API
   - Demo mode: Simulates API calls (no credentials needed for demo)
   - Production mode: Appends extracted data to real Google Sheets
   - Supports data export to JSON

5. **CV Manager** (`cv_manager.py`)
   - **Orchestrator**: Coordinates all components
   - Processes incoming messages end-to-end
   - Maintains processing logs and statistics
   - Generates summary reports
